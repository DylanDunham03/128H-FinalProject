# 128H-ML-Optimization

Group Name: CODE-STORAGE

Group Members: Dylan, Aakash, Idrees

Net Id's: dylanad2, imoha9

Project Introduction:
  We want to test how quickly AI can guess user-generated models. Specifically, we will create patterns of asteriods in space race and see how quickly the AI can learn said pattern and optimize.


System Overview:
  1) Creating the actual Space Race game
    a) Timer
    b) Rocket that responds to keyboard input (if we want to implement user control)
    c) Asteriods that interact with rocket and have a set pattern of generation
    d) Graphics for all of the above
  2) AI System
    a) Controlling the rocket
    b) System that tries to learn the pattern of asteriods and edit behavior based on that

Language: Rust

Possible Challenges:
  1) Graphics
  2) Creating the system where the AI can learn the asteriod pattern
